This template is a simple lift tracker that I have been using for a while to track all of my workouts. It is perfect for people wanting to track their strength progress all in Notion, and can be customized further to suit your specific needs.

## How it works

**Rows**

Each row in the table corresponds to one exercise completed within a workout. For example, if you did three sets of the exercise bench press, that would be on a row.


**Columns**

Each exercise has many columns applied to it.

- Body Weight (Number): Weight on the day of the lift
- Exercise (Select): What exercise is it? (Ex. Squat, OHP, Bench, etc)
- Date (Date): Date you completed the exercise
- Weight (Number): Weight for sets 1-6
- Reps (Number): Reps for sets 1-6
- 1 RM (Formula): 1 rep max estimation
- Relative Strength (Formula): Compareps your 1 rep max to your weight

## Customizations

You may want to customize certain aspects of this tracker. Here are some examples:

1. Exercises: The exercise select has a very basic set of exercises that should be expanded to suit your needs
2. Set/Weight Columns: 1-6 are included but if you do more or less you can add or remove columns accordingly
3. Charts: Notion allows you to chart tables with the pro plan. Some ideas for charts include: Weight (Body or Exercise) x Date, Relative Strength x Date, etc
