Tactical Trials is a low poly first person shooter where you you shoot and destroy targets across the map. This is my first “game” outside of tutorials. The main aim of this project was to learn the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 5 and prepare me for the future. Some concepts covered are custom 3D modeling/texturing, map creation, sounds effects, Niagara particles, C++ and blueprints, timers, ray casts, and much more.
