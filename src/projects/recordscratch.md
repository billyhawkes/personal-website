RecordScratch is a social music rating app inspired by Letterboxd and IMDB and available worldwide on the App Store and Google Play.

## Features

Some of the main features in RecordScratch are:

- Rating/Reviewing
- Social Aspects (Following, Liking, Commenting)
- Feed
- Search and explore music
- Rating Distributions 

## How it is made

RecordScratch is built primarily using React Native, Expo, tRPC, and Tailwind. It started as a web based platform with Vinxi and Tanstack Router at its core but was rebuilt using React Native to allow for a better mobile experience. While the web is still available, we have stopped supporting it as much to focus on mobile. 

It is made in collaboration with one other developer, Filip Slepcev, and was built over a year as a side project.

## Usage

At this point the app has over 50K Ratings and 700 users!
